## About Digital Companion

[![Video Label](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Mtd21gnQ2cg/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Mtd21gnQ2cg?t=0s)

<b>[Autonomous Digital Companion]</b> is a research project generalized by [KETI] (Korea Electronics Technnology Institute), supported by the [IITP] (Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion) grant funded by the [Ministry of Science and ICT] (MSIT, a ministry of the Government of South Korea). This is a fundamental study for designing companions who provide the help you need for daily life. They also help you manage a better life and they respond to you out of sympathy because they understand your thoughts and intentions.

Autonomous Digital Companion has 6 key characters.
- <b>Autonomy</b> : <b>Judge and operate itself</b> based on the surrounding situation and adaptive learning without the user's direct command
- <b>Sociality</b> : Actively interact with <b>the user and their companions</b> based on user intentions
- <b>Reactivity</b> : Understand groups of users and other companions and their surroundings and <b>respond appropriately and quickly to changes</b> occurring in them
- <b>Activity</b> : <b>Prepare for action preemptively</b> based on adaptive learning and comprehensive reasoning beyond simply responding to the environment
- <b>Time Continuity</b> : Get time-series intelligence to <b>understand the user's context</b> based on current situation and continuous learning intelligence
- <b>Situational adaptability</b> : Support <b>decision making for the user's surroundings</b> through hybrid learning that understands user intent and surroundings

This project has 4 particular objects.
- Autonomous digital companion framework and application service
- Adaptive machine learning
- Intelligent interaction
- Emotional intelligence

## About CESLeA

<b>[CESLeA]</b> is the third detailed project of Autonomous Digital Companion. It is an intelligent interaction technology research and development project that analyzes multi-modal data with AI learning techniques to grasp environment and user's state. It also interprets it with context-aware information including contextual understanding.

CESLeA consists of 4 teams and lasts 5 years. We call it as SHE&I with CESLeA.
- SHE&I : Goals for each teams
  - Situation & Interaction - Team I : Autonomic Intelligent Interaction based on Integrated Situation Awareness
  - Human & Interaction - Team II : User Understanding and Personal Adaptive Interaction
  - Environment & Interaction - Team III : Interaction based on Understanding Environment Considering Context Information
  - &(N)atural & Interaction - Team IV : Natural Reaction and Interaction Expression, Execution and Reinforcement
- CESLeA : Goals for each years
  - Communication - 1st Year Communicative Interaction : Conversation Ability - Foundation Technology Development
  - Emphathy - 2nd Year Emphathic Interaction : Conversation Understanding - Core Technology Development
  - Sharing - 3rd Year Communional Interaction : Conversation Progress - Sub-module Completion and Alpha Prototype Implementation
  - Leading - 4th Year Leading Interaction : Without Conversation - Module Performance Improvement and Advancement
  - Autonomy - 5th Year Spontaneous Interaction : Take care of itself - Real Environment Evaluation and Optimization

## About iSPL's Contribution

Combining Localization and Human activity recognition leads to a system having the ability to learn and understand a User's behavior and predict their intended actions. Using the latest in combined local and global location information and human activity data, our module provides the digital companion with this ability.

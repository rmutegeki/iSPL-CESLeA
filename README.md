<!--- Short introduction -->
This is a repository for ISPL's turnkey project on Behavioral Prediction (인식예측). We use IMU sensor data collected from standalone sensor devices, smartphones, smartwatches and other on-body gadgets to learn a user's behaviour and predict their patterns.

This project is currently under development.

## Contribution guidelines

If you want to contribute to this software, be sure to review the [contribution guidelines]. This project adheres to the [code of conduct]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Introduction

Check [Introduction file] to read full version. This is summary.

<b>[Autonomous Digital Companion]</b> is a research project generalized by [KETI] (Korea Electronics Technnology Institute), supported by the [IITP] (Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion) grant funded by the [Ministry of Science and ICT] (MSIT, a ministry of the Government of South Korea). This is a fundamental study for designing companions who provide the help you need for daily life. They also help you manage a better life and they respond to you out of sympathy because they understand your thoughts and intentions.

<b>[CESLeA]</b> is the third detailed project of Autonomous Digital Companion. It is an intelligent interaction technology research and development project that analyzes multi-modal data with AI learning techniques to grasp environment and user's state. It also interprets it with context-aware information including contextual understanding.

<!---
Write short introduction of your module.
DONT WRITE TOO MUCH. README is manual not historical textbook.
